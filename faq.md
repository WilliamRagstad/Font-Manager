- **Q: Will I risk being VAC banned?**

- A: Short answer: **No**.

  Long explanation: 

  - *"Certain files are VAC protected. If you modify these files, you can be VAC banned. But you can change things like the mini-map graphics without being banned. Generally speaking, players can be banned for making changes to core game files in CSGO. There are also numerous guides on Steam CSGO community hub that detail how to change various parts of the UI including fonts. I doubt that it would have got 1000 upvotes if it was telling players to do something that would get them VAC banned."* - **BossGalaga**'s answer to the question in [this discussion](https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/9/135513901704720033/).
  - *"So im using a font right now and i haven't been vac banned yet xD and i guess i wont get one cuz a lot of people also use one and don't get a ban."* - **stayyCS**.
  - *"Font styles can be changed. No, fonts don't get you vac banned."* - **xKodaCSGO**.
  - *"Nope no vac ban look on my account"* - **spddl**.
  
  *(If you are still not convinced, I can point out that many famous youtubers use unofficial fonts in CS:GO all the time.)*




- **Q: My font won't work... What shall I do?**
- A: There could me multiple reasons why your font doesn't work. Here are the general problems and solutions:

  1. **The font was installed incorrectly.**
This might only be solved by manually uninstalling the font in `C:\Windows\Fonts` and then reinstalling it through Font Manager. But be aware that not all fonts are possible to use with Font Manager. This is not due to poor software development, but some fonts are not recognizable by CS:GO.

  2. **The CS:GO path is incorrect.**
Font Manager should warn of this when installing/applying fonts. You can fix it by pressing the "Reset" link at the bottom of the main window.


- **Q: Why can't I drag and drop anymore?**
A: It depends on if you're running Font Manager as Administrator, in such case, restart the program with user privileges.


- **Q: How do I rename fonts in Font Manager?**
- A: There is no way to do it inside the program itself. Therefore you'll just need to rename the font directory itself inside the following folder: `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Documents\Font Manager\Fonts`


- **Q: How do I uninstall Font Manager?**
- A: Well, there is not uninstaller. So you must delete the folder and the program yourself:
  1. Delete the folder: `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Documents\Font Manager`
  2. Delete: `Font Manager.exe`
  3. **Done!** It's all gone :)
