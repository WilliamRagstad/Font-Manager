## About

### 0 History

Font Manager was developed due to a lack of utility softwares that utilized the font changing possibility for csgo.
What it does is providing a simple user interface in which fonts are easily previewed, re-sized and applied to the game.

Today, Font Manager has over 35 000 downloads and is vastly known as the best program for this task. This is something I am verry proud of!

Due to this project not being sponsored or lacking features, this is sadly no longer in development and might become deprecated.

### 1 Windows

#### 1.1 Main

The main window is consisting of a list view representing your current Font Library. These fonts can be applied to CS:GO.

When a font is selected, the "Apply Selected Font" button will appear, pressing this will prompt you to change the current CS:GO font. If you confirm this, the program will change your font in CS:GO to the new one.

In case you appreciate the program, there is also a button for donations in the shape of trade offers through Steam. 

At the bottom of the window is version information as well as a link to restore the saved path to the CS:GO local files, and a link to see additional information about Font Manager.

##### 1.1.1 Add font

 To add a font, press the green "+" button or drag-and-drop directly into the font list. 

##### 1.1.2 Remove font

 To delete a font from the Font Manager, you need to select it from the font library and then press the red "X" button. 

> ### NOTICE
> **This will NOT uninstall the font from your computer**! This must be done *manually*.

#### 1.2 Add Font

The add font window looks the same as the main window, but here you can select from a list of already installed fonts on your computer. Select one and press the "Add Selected Font" button.
