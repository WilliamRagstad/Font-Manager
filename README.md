## About

### 0 History

Font Manager was developed due to a lack of utility softwares that utilized the font changing possibility for csgo.
What it does is providing a simple user interface in which fonts are easily previewed, re-sized and applied to the game.

Today, Font Manager has over 60 000 downloads and is vastly known as the best program for this task. This is something I am verry proud of!
Tho, due to this project not being sponsored, this is sadly no longer in active development and might become deprecated. There will still be new update releases but with longer waiting periods.

### 1 Windows

#### 1.1 Main

The main window is consisting of a list view representing your current Font Library. These fonts can be applied to CS:GO.

When a font is selected, the "Apply Selected Font" button will appear, pressing this will prompt you to change the current CS:GO font. If you confirm this, the program will change your font in CS:GO to the new one.

In case you appreciate the program, there is also a button for donations in the shape of trade offers through Steam. 

At the bottom of the window is version information as well as a link to restore the saved path to the CS:GO local files, and a link to see additional information about Font Manager.

##### 1.1.1 Add font

 To add a font, press the green "+" button or drag-and-drop directly into the font list. 

##### 1.1.2 Remove font

 To delete a font from the Font Manager, you need to select it from the font library and then press the red "X" button. 

> ### NOTICE
> **This will NOT uninstall the font from your computer**! This must be done *manually*.

#### 1.2 Add Font

The add font window looks the same as the main window, but here you can select from a list of already installed fonts on your computer. Select one and press the "Add Selected Font" button.
